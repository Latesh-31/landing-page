// The original script.js functionality for integration hover and testimonial carousel is removed
// as those sections have been redesigned in the HTML to match the video. No new complex JS
// is currently required based on the provided video's interactions.

// Basic example if any new interactions are added later:
// document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
//     console.log('Aligno landing page loaded.');
// });
