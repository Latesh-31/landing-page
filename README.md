## Setup and Running

To view this landing page, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Create project files:**
    Create a new directory for your project. Inside this directory, create two files: `index.html` and `README.md`.

2.  **Populate files:**
    Copy the provided content for `index.html` into your `index.html` file, and the content for `README.md` into your `README.md` file.

3.  **Open in Browser:**
    Navigate to your project directory and open the `index.html` file directly in your preferred web browser. You can typically do this by double-clicking the file.

    For development purposes, you might want to use a local web server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code) to easily refresh changes, though it's not strictly necessary for a static HTML file.
